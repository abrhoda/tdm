1. look for all items that have a usage that starts with:
- "etched-onto"
- "applied-to"
this will get too many items.
2. remove from the list any items that have the word "vehicle" in the usage.
3. remove from the list any items that have the "adjustment" trait.

That should filter to just the runes. Now sort them.

4. All weapon runes start with "etched-onto" and have the word "weapon" or the word "clan-dagger" in the usage string.
5. All armor runes start with "etched-onto" and have the word "armor" in the usage string.
6. For weapon runes, sort by fundamental vs property
7. For armor runes, sort by fundamental vs property
8. All other runes are accessory runes.
9. Think about separating clan dagger filigrees into a separate table.
